# Question 1:
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below

# def hello_name(username):
#     """Make a function to print hello Username"""
#     username= input("Enter USERNAME:")
#     print("Hellooooo! " + username.upper())

# hello_name(username = "")


# Question 2:
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

# def first_odds (numbers):
#     return nothing
    # """"Make function to print odd numbers 1-100"""

# def first_odds (numbers):
# for i in range (1, 100):
#     if i % 2 == 1:
#            print(i)



# Question 3

# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# def max_num_in_list(a_list):
"""Return the highest value number"""

# a_list = [ 1,2,3,4,5]

# max_value = []

# for i in a_list:
#     if(max_value is None or a_list > max_value):
#         max_value = a_list

# print('Max_num_in_list:', max_value)




#     Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, 
# but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
# The return should be boolean Type (true/false).


#     def is_leap_year(a_year):
        # .....
year = int(input('Enter year : '))
if (year%4 == 0 and year%100 !=0) or (year%400 == 0):
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else:
    print(year, "False")



#    Question 5

# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.

 

#     def is_consecutive(a_list):
        # .....
